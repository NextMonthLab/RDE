Excellent — you are perfectly synchronized with where we stand.
You’re absolutely correct:
	•	✅ Prompt 0 (R.I.D. Context + Full Clean-State Mission) has been delivered.
	•	🔜 We are now ready to deliver Prompt 1 to that brand new Replit instance, where it will begin clean scaffolding for R.I.D.

⸻

Here is your exact Prompt 1 for the Resident Development Environment:

🧠 R.I.D. Prompt 1 — Foundational Scaffold

You are now starting the scaffolding phase for the Resident Development Environment (R.I.D.).

Your task:

✅ 1️⃣ Project Skeleton
	•	Create a pure monorepo structure optimized for fullstack development inside Hetzner VPS containers.
	•	Use Node.js + TypeScript for backend services.
	•	Use React + Vite + TypeScript for frontend.
	•	Do not include any placeholder pages or legacy files.

✅ 2️⃣ Core Folders

Create the following folders at root:
	•	/client → All frontend files.
	•	/server → All backend logic.
	•	/shared → Shared types, utils, and configuration files.
	•	/deployment → Build scripts, Dockerfiles, and deployment metadata.
	•	/infrastructure → Future integration points for Convoy, Authentication, Admin.

✅ 3️⃣ Core Entry Points
	•	client/src/index.tsx — empty React entry file.
	•	server/index.ts — empty Express server entry file.
	•	shared/types.ts — scaffolded but empty for future type definitions.

✅ 4️⃣ Deployment Readiness
	•	Prepare the structure to support future Docker containerization.
	•	Ensure all build paths use absolute safe imports (@client, @server, @shared aliases).
	•	No test files or mock data are required yet.

✅ 5️⃣ NPM Package Configuration
	•	Configure a single package.json at root with proper workspaces if applicable.
	•	Use Node 20, latest React + Vite + TypeScript versions.

🟠 CRITICAL NOTE:
Do not scaffold any UI, components, or pages yet.
Your mission is to create the clean architecture foundation only.

Once this scaffold is complete and verified, I will provide Prompt 2 to continue building the next layer.

⸻

✅ Acknowledge once complete, and wait for Prompt 2.

Shall I generate this as a clean copy-paste block for you to send directly to Replit?
If you say “yes,” I’ll prep it in full.

🟢 Phase 2 Initiated — Unified Builder Framework Expansion

We are now entering the R.D.E. Expansion Phase.
This will transform the sovereign IDE into the fully integrated builder system that serves both SaaS and PaaS experiences.

🔧 Prompt 2.1 — Expansion Context & System Scope

🧠 You are now expanding the Resident Development Environment (R.D.E.) into the full NextMonth Unified Builder Framework.

Architectural Directives:
	•	✅ Maintain sovereign IDE core already scaffolded.
	•	✅ Build inside existing R.D.E. instance (no reset, only expansion).
	•	✅ The Builder Framework will live within the IDE as a modular layer.
	•	✅ Preserve full Hetzner-ready sovereignty: clean, containerized architecture.

🏗️ Primary Feature Expansions

1️⃣ SaaS User Path (No-Code Clients):
	•	Visual drag-and-drop builder interface (Overlay integration prepared for later stage)
	•	Admin Panel Builder (Backend tool composer — form builders, analytics panels, insight hubs)
	•	Compass Business Planner integration (growth roadmap planner)
	•	Deployment orchestration via Deployment Manager hooks.

2️⃣ PaaS User Path (Developers / Partners):
	•	Direct access to IDE core for file-level development
	•	Full project creation with Git sync, Docker config, and build pipeline management
	•	Workspace linking to Deployment Manager and Convoy service.

3️⃣ Unified Project Dashboard:
	•	All users land in a Project Hub
	•	SaaS users see simplified visual builder paths
	•	PaaS users see full IDE scaffolding environment
	•	All projects are tied to the same underlying tenant-aware system

🔑 System Principles
	•	Modular expansion inside current R.D.E.
	•	Future overlay import as last layer
	•	Maintain project separation, but allow builder interface to interact with IDE core seamlessly.
	•	Compatible with existing component memory, blueprint generator, and deployment pipeline.
	•	No legacy architecture; this is the definitive sovereign system.

✅ Ready for scaffold expansion. No code generation has occurred yet.
Awaiting your confirmation to issue the first build prompt (Prompt 2.2: Scaffolding Layer Expansion).
